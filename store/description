Reclaim your right to seek! Take back control of videos on the web by reversing the pretty annoying trend of tech companies removing it. Seek Anywhere will add a seek (progress) bar anywhere on the web that it should rightfully be! That is, on YouTube Shorts, Instagram, or Facebook reels.

Companies remove your right to seek to keep you hooked. When you start a video, you don't know what the time commitment will be. If you miss a part of it, you are much more likely to wait till the end and rewatch a whole video. If you skip but change your mind and want to go back, you are "punished" by having to watch from the start.

Personally I found that when I have the seeking bars re-enabled, these short form videos become a lot less addictive.

Platforms:

YouTube

YouTube does have its own seek bar, but it's kept out of view and it doesn't allow the user to tell the length of the video at a glance.

YouTube Shorts interface is crazy cluttered, so we have some options to remove most elements from view.

Facebook

Facebook has a crazy amount of clutter on its reels, and also no seeking controls.

Facebook's HTML structure is extremely obfuscated, so we just removed all the clutter and added a seek bar. If anyone wants to add more fine-grained control, PRs are most welcome here!

Instagram

Instagram has a pretty clean video interface, so we only add native seeking controls.
