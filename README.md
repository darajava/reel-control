# Seek Anywhere

**Reclaim your right to seek!**

Take back control of videos on the web. Seek Anywhere will add a seek (progress) bar anywhere on the web that it should rightfully be! That is, on YouTube Shorts, Instagram, or Facebook reels.

---

## Why?

Platforms deliberately remove your right to seek:

- To keep you watching without knowing how long a video is
- To "punish" skipping by making you start over
- To increase replays when you miss something

With seek bars restored, short-form video becomes **less addictive** and much more respectful of your time.
